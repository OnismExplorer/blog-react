Introduction: A modern personal blog system built with React + Vite + TypeScript, featuring Ant Design components and Tailwind CSS styling (Blog site: [onism.cn](https://onism.cn), welcome to visit, please don't attack me (ToT)/~~~)

## üé® Preface

### üß® Personal Story

During the summer of 2023, I decided to build my own personal blog to share my thoughts and essays. On one hand, I wanted to familiarize myself with frontend-backend interactions and deployment processes (including server configuration, domain registration and filing, SSL certificates and HTTPS configuration...). On the other hand, I was looking for something productive to do (~~got tired of gaming, nothing else to do~~).

So I started searching for open-source blog frontend code on the internet (mainly on GitHub and Gitee), as I'm primarily a backend developer. I found several that looked promising, but they either lacked documentation or were no longer maintained, which was discouraging...

After searching for a while, I finally found [Most Beautiful Blog (Challenge Most Beautiful Blog)](https://gitee.com/littledokey/poetize-vue2) on Gitee (author's site: [poetize.cn](https://poetize.cn)). The interface was beautiful, the features were comprehensive, and the author was still actively maintaining it with a community chat group. That's where my journey began...

### ü§Ø Frontend Dream
Through documentation and guidance from the community experts, along with searching for solutions to various problems online (development is about discovering problems, solving problems, and creating new problems ~~just kidding~~), I finally got the blog code deployed after much effort. I was quite happy about it.

So why did I want to refactor the blog using React and TypeScript?

One day, I had a sudden inspiration to add a music player to my blog's homepage (calling random music APIs to implement music playback functionality). However, due to my insufficient understanding of JavaScript's weak typing characteristics (I was used to strongly-typed languages in backend development, so not specifying types often left me confused about variable types), and being a frontend newbie at the time, I often spent hours debugging because of unclear variable types. I was particularly tormented by those recurring `undefined` errors (no language/technology is superior to another, I was just too inexperienced back then QAQ).

Considering that I might add more of my whimsical ideas to the blog later (although I'm a backend developer, I've always had a frontend dream), I decided that short-term pain was better than long-term pain. After researching, I chose to refactor the blog using mainstream frameworks like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Ant Design (writing TypeScript gave me a feeling similar to writing backend code).

However, due to various factors like other project plans, competitions, internships, etc., this task kept getting postponed. It wasn't until this year that I finally had substantial personal time to address this "concern".

In recent years, AI has become increasingly intelligent, and using it to assist development has significantly improved efficiency (60% of this refactoring was thanks to AI; things that might have taken a long time to learn before can now be achieved through AI interaction and fine-tuning, while also explaining the reasoning behind the approach, lowering the technical barrier). It only took me just over a month to complete.

### üîé Key Differences
The refactored version is based on the version I obtained at that time (2023.x version, relatively outdated compared to the current version by the [poetize](https://poetize.cn) author), so some features are missing. Since my initial purpose for the blog was to post my notes and essays, I didn't implement the IM (Instant Messaging) section, only refactoring the frontend and backend management parts.

Since the frontend layout/animations were already beautiful and quite perfect, I maintained the original state during refactoring. The backend consists mostly of tables, but since articles and resource data are extensive, I uniformly adopted in-page scrolling tables + pagination. I also added light/dark theme toggle buttons to the backend management (using article management as an example, as shown below):

![](static/README/background.png)

Additionally, I added quick action shortcuts to the backend "Welcome" page, along with different greetings for different time periods:

![](static/README/welcome.png)

A loading animation page was added for transitions between frontend page switches:

![](static/README/loading.png)

The following optimizations were also implemented:

- Added 404 Not Found page to avoid blank screen issues when incorrect routes are entered
  ![](static/README/not-found.png)

- Fixed blank screen/error issues that could occur when viewing articles with incorrect article IDs (solution: redirect to 404 page)

### üßê Future Plans

Todo list:

- [ ] Complete refactoring of the "Love Wall" frontend page (currently not needed, so not refactored yet, opens to 404 page)
- [ ] Configuration management functionality (e.g., navbar configuration, footer information can be directly configured through backend without manually modifying code)
- [ ] Integration of virtual assistant (Live2D character)
- [ ] AI chat/search integration (considering fusion with virtual assistant)
- [ ] AI article summary/infographic/streamlined version (helping readers quickly extract key article information)
- [ ] Fix potential bugs (welcome everyone to submit issues)
- [ ] Support Docker one-click deployment (lazy person's essential)
- [ ] Other imaginative ideas (haven't thought of any yet, placeholder for now)
- ...

I'll be preparing for campus recruitment (autumn/spring recruitment) next, so there might be breaks in updates/maintenance. Once I land a job, I'll promptly address existing issues and prepare for upcoming plans.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### Requirements
- Node.js >= 18.0.0 (developed with v22.8.0)
- npm >= 8.0.0 or yarn >= 1.22.0

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/OnismExplorer/blog-react.git
cd blog-react

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Configuration

There are two environment configuration files in the project root directory. `.env.development` is for local development/testing environment, and `.env.production` is for production (server) environment.

These files are used to configure the backend service API addresses.

Therefore, the `.env.development` file contains addresses like localhost/127.0.0.1/192.168.xx.xx (LAN IP, needed for mobile testing in LAN, otherwise cannot access backend service),
while the `.env.production` file contains **server IP address**/domain (if available), etc.

> **.env.development** file

```env
# Development environment - Backend API base URL
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081
VITE_WEB_URL=http://localhost
```

> **.env.production** file

```env
# Production environment - Backend API base URL (/api should be included, for nginx configuration, replace localhost with corresponding server IP/domain)
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081/api
VITE_WEB_URL=http://localhost
```

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) to view the website (if backend service is not started, data cannot be fetched and an "Error occurred" prompt will appear)

## üìù Available Scripts

```bash
# Start development server (local development)
npm run dev

# Build production version: First execute TypeScript project reference batch build, then execute Vite packaging
npm run build

# Type checking: "Only do type checking, no output files", commonly used in CI or pre-commit
npm run type-check

# Code checking: Full project ESLint check, can be linked with Prettier for formatting (relatively strict, won't let warnings pass)
npm run lint

# Preview production build: Preview static files built by build (first run npm run build to generate dist files, then execute this command, usually used for preview checking before production deployment), typically runs on http://localhost:4173
npm run preview
```

The most important commands are `npm run dev` and `npm run build`, the former is for local running and the latter is for building.

## üé® Theme Configuration

The project supports light/dark theme switching, theme configuration is located at:

- **Tailwind Theme**: `tailwind.config.js`
- **Ant Design Theme**: `src/AppContent.tsx`
- **CSS Variables**: `src/assets/css/index.css`

### Custom Colors

CSS variables defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

```css
:root {
  --background: #ffffff;
  --fontColor: #333333;
  --borderColor: #e5e5e5;
  /* ... more variables */
}

.dark {
  --background: #1a1a1a;
  --fontColor: #ffffff;
  --borderColor: #404040;
  /* ... dark theme variables */
}
```

```

</details>

If using [BT Panel](https://www.bt.cn/new/index.html) for deployment, SSL certificates can be directly managed there.

### Additional Notes

1. In `@components/common/footer.tsx`, you need to change the `ICP registration number` to the actual registration number (for domestic domain registration)
2. The project uses Qiniu Cloud CDN storage, which requires self-registration and configuration: [Qiniu Cloud](https://www.qiniu.com/)
3. After successful deployment, the backend management address is: [http://localhost/admin](http://localhost/admin) (this is an example for development environment; for production environment, replace `http://localhost` with the corresponding protocol + IP/domain)
4. The backend code used by the project is not directly taken from [poetize.cn](https://poetize.cn)'s backend code but has been modified to some extent (most API endpoints match). It's currently not open-sourced (will be open-sourced later), so the backend can be developed independently for now.

## ü§ù Contributing
